# TicTacToe
I managed to finish this project by implementing Canvas Functions such as drawtext(), drawBitmap(), and the use of Singleton-object(in Kotlin). Another helpful tool was embedding LinearLayout into LinearLayout and using the "gravity" property. This project was also a practice of Clean Code Principles such as continuous delivery, maintainability, code quality and software life cycle.

View Hierarchy was :
View: can be displayed on the screen
->TextView
->Button
->ImageView
->Custom views

 With the use of custom class, I extended the View subclasses, and the method I used for game model structure is a 2D array, O: empty 1: circle 2:cross.
